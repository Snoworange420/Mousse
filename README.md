## Info
Everything that is skidded for now:

- Candy CA
- Rusherhack's ShulkerPreview idea
- Guinness and Ruby's Hopperradius idea
- Pesudo client's 32k Grab, Silent swap Auto32k and 32kAura idea
- Utils
- Commands from postman

## Comment
- Since I have coded some 32k modules I will now focus on bug fixing and add "casual" modules (e.g. Speed, KillAura, AutoTotem..)
- Most of the code is skidded/copyed from open-source clients. The client developing is in progress.
*Since some code is messy I don't recommend to use this client as a instance!!!!*

## Huge thanks to:
- My dad and my mom for my balls
- Minecraft and MinecraftForge (without those boiz we can't make client)
- Pseudonymous000 for helping me out with client developing
- Minnced for DiscordRPC
- SpongePowored for mixins
- nk2ywsa / sheplet for inspiration to make this client
